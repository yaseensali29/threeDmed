Hello, so our project is threeDmed, an informational website for visualizing the anatomy of the human body.
SO for instance, our homepage would be something like this, a full human anatomy, 
where you could click say, the stomach, and be brought to another page with a 3D stomach model.
Now, I know that might not sound impressive, but what if you could step in to the stomach itself?
Well, we'll also have a visualization built in three.js with a 1st person view inside the stomach, as if you were in the belly of the beast, floating on a piece of toast while trying to take cover from all the acid flying around. 
If that's too much to stomach, we'll also breathe life into the lungs, and make one that's lighter on the heart. Thank You.
